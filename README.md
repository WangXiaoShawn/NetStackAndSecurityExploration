The experiments conducted in this repository are derived from the Seeds Lab 2.0, a project designed by Professor Duwenliang of Syracuse University. More details can be found at [Seeds Lab 2.0](https://seedsecuritylabs.org/Labs_20.04/).

The methods and explanations employed in each experiment draw heavily from Professor Du's textbook, "Computer Security: A Hands-on Approach (Computer & Internet Security) 3rd ed. Edition", which is available for purchase on [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Computer-Security-Hands-Approach-Internet/dp/1733003959/ref=sr_1_1?crid=130PN3JSIC6C5&keywords=computer+security+du&qid=1683863116&sprefix=computer+secuity+du%2Caps%2C245&sr=8-1).

It is strongly recommended to familiarize yourself with the textbook before attempting these labs. Each lab includes detailed implementations, observations, and personal insights that reflect my understanding of the phenomena at hand.
