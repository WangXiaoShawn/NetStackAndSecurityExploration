# :mortar_board: Network Protocols Labs

Welcome to my series of experiments, which are based on the renowned **Seeds Lab 2.0** project, masterminded by *Professor Du wenliang* of Syracuse University :school:.

You can find more about the Seeds Lab 2.0 framework here: [Seeds Lab 2.0](https://seedsecuritylabs.org/Labs_20.04/).

## :books: Reference Textbook

These experiments follow the teachings and guidelines from Professor Du's book:

> **_"Computer Security: A Hands-on Approach (Computer & Internet Security) 3rd ed. Edition"_**

This insightful textbook is available for purchase on [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Computer-Security-Hands-Approach-Internet/dp/1733003959/ref=sr_1_1?crid=130PN3JSIC6C5&keywords=computer+security+du&qid=1683863116&sprefix=computer+secuity+du%2Caps%2C245&sr=8-1).

:warning: I strongly recommend getting familiar with the textbook before diving into these labs.
